# CODSOFT
Hello my name is Swastik Ghosh, an intern at Codesoft. 

and I have successfully completed all the tasks of the Web Development Internship programme by CodSoft. 

It was an incredibly rewarding journey. I really enjoyed doing all the tasks of Level 1 like Landing Page, Portfolio, Calculator . Throughout the internship, I also had the opportunity to refine my skills in web Development and it helped me to learn many different things also. 

Thank you CodSoft for providing me this opportunity.
